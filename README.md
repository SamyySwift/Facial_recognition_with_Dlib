### üéØ **Overview:**
In this project, I developed a real-time face-recognition system with liveliness detection to recognize images of zummit Africa employees with an accuracy of 90% and deployed on a Jetson Nano. The system is built such that if an employee is recognized, the Python text to speech will give an audio output the person's name otherwise it will say Unknown Person.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & Frameworks:**
- Face-Recognition Library
- OpenCV
- Jetson Nano
- Numpy
- Usb Camera
- Pillow
- Python text to speech library
